# Web App for Testing Graph Properties

The application designed for testing graph properties enables users to interactively assess whether a graph possesses certain characteristics. These include being simple, connected, Eulerian, semi-Eulerian, Hamiltonian, semi-Hamiltonian, having bridges, and determining its chromatic number and chromatic index.

A graph is considered simple if no two vertices are connected by more than one edge, and there is no edge that starts and ends at the same vertex. Connectivity in a graph implies that it cannot be represented as the combination of two separate graphs. Eulerian graphs contain an Eulerian path, a closed path traversing every edge, while semi-Eulerian graphs have a path that includes every edge. Hamiltonian graphs feature a Hamiltonian cycle, a cycle passing through all vertices, whereas semi-Hamiltonian graphs contain a path through every vertex.

In a connected graph, a bridge is an edge whose removal results in a disconnected graph. In a disconnected graph, a bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components, which are parts of the union of connected graphs representing a disconnected graph. The chromatic number signifies the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph, ensuring that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The chromatic index represents the minimum number of colors required to color the edges of the graph, preventing any two adjacent edges from sharing the same color.
